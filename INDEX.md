# Quiz Marking System - Issue Resolution Index

## 🎯 The Issue: "No Quiz Found" Error ❌

When teachers clicked "Mark Result" to review student quiz submissions, they got:
> **"No Quiz Found"** or **"Quiz not found"** error

This prevented teachers from:
- ✗ Viewing student answers
- ✗ Marking quizzes
- ✗ Publishing results
- ✗ Completing the workflow

---

## ✅ The Solution: Complete

**Status**: ✅ FIXED AND TESTED

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing `createdBy` field in quiz population
- Redundant database queries
- Insufficient null checks

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `createdBy` to quiz population
- Removed redundant queries
- Added proper error handling
- Optimized database access
